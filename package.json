A King who, while he protects his people, is defied by foes, be they equal in strength, or stronger, or weaker, must not shrink from battle, remembering the duty of Kings. Not to turn back in battle, to protect the people, to honour the Brahmanas, is the best means for a King to secure happiness. But the King who is conquered in battle, while he turns back in fear, takes upon himself all the sin of his master, whatever it may be. The highest duty of a King is to protect the people, for the King who enjoys the rewards, just mentioned, is bound to discharge that duty.",
